                            We took our first step toward promoting quality education by training 10 students in communication skills within a corporate structure, guided by the dedicated mentorship of Ms. Bonny Roy. Her impactful classes transformed the students, allowing them to emerge with enhanced skills and confidence. Ms. Bonny Roy, an English teacher at Lalaji Memorial Omega International School, graciously accepted our request to lead this program. She had been a mentor to our Founder during his school years, instilling valuable principles that have shaped this initiative. This 6-day program was a success with all positive reviews and thanks to Genik Technologies Pvt Ltd for their unwavering support.
